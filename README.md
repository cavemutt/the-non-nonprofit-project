# React + Vite

This is the beginnings of a website called "The Non-nonProfit Project" which will be able to connect those who help others but may not be an official non-profit organization with those who want to help them achieve their goals. This site was built using Vite with React v.18, React-Router v.5, and vanilla CSS, using MockAPI as the CRUD-capable development database. Photos are from unsplash and are credited in the footer of each page. An initial styling mockup was created in Photoshop to help with planning and styling. 

The goal is for this to become a real working website. This is still very much a work in progress. 

Thanks for looking!

// Next Steps :
// - functional burger menu on smaller sizes on pages needed
// - styling -- worked on but still some issues --> look good on all device sizes
// - local storage for hasLoadedBefore to control animations
// - animations/parallax
// - aria labels/accessibility checks
// - dynamically displayed footer with however many photo credits needed
// - uninstall bootstrap if not going to use
// - deploy to AWS

// on Signup page
// - need to verify password with second entry
// - need to hash password and store separately

// on Org page 
// - scroll to update section on update button click
// - login popup to authenticate when update or delete is clicked 
// - action for forgot/reset password needed 
// - the textarea and org displays need cleaning up, controlled to look neater
// - use a real database, real urls
